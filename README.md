# Deployer

Auto-Scaling Continuous Deployment Helper


 * Easily notify machines that builds are ready to be deployed
 * Configuration for multiple methods to notify your machines
 * Works across auto scaling methodologies


## Configuration

There is a configuration file called deployer.cfg . This file holds all of the keys and endpoints needed for connecting to your system

 * Messaging Queues (RabbitMQ, ZeroMQ, etc...)
 * Amazon SQS
 * Pusher (Websocket)

And here's some code!

```python
[MQSERVER]
endpoint = mq.endpoint.io
queue = deploy
command = echo $PATH

[AWSSQS]
endpoint = mq.endpoint.io
queue = deployer
region = us-west-2
key = AWSKEY
secret = AWSECRET
command = echo $HOME

[PUSHER]
app_id = 00000
key = xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
secret = xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
channel = deployer
event = deploy
command = echo $PATH
```

The command key is the important part. You can run any script or bash command. For example:
```bash
source /home/env/myapp/bin/activate && cd /home/apps/myapp/ && fab production >> /var/log/fabric/cron.log 2>&1
```

## How to Run
```bash
$ virtualenv deployer # or use virtualenvwrapper
$ source deployer/bin/activate
$ pip install .
$ nohup deployer &> /path/to/log/deployer.out
```

## Running Tests
You need to make a copy of the `src/tests/test_config_example.py` and add correct values for the variables.

```
$ make test
```

This code is very much an __alpha__ version. Please test and integrate properly before you integrate this into your production systems.
